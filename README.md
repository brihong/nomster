# Nomster

App created for a project during coding bootcamp where users can post information about places and restaurants they have visited. Users can upload photos, post comments and submit ratings. A public dashboard is also available for each user to showcase their activity.

The application was built on a Ruby on Rails framework. The information is saved to a PostgreSQL database. Devise is used for user authentication. The Geocoder API displays Google Maps when a correct street address is entered. SendGrid helps with notifying a user via email when someone else leaves a comment for the restaurant they have shared information on.
